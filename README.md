# Student-Performance-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
**Predicting Student Academic Performance using Regression-Based Machine Learning Models**

**Course:** Machine Learning / Data Science

**Lab No:** 

**Title:** Student Performance Prediction using Feature Engineering and Multiple Regression Models

**Duration:** 2 hours

**Tools:** Python, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM, Jupyter Notebook

**Objective**
By the end of this lab, students will be able to:

Preprocess raw educational data (handling missing values, encoding, scaling).

Train multiple regression models (MLP, XGBoost, LightGBM, Random Forest, SVM).

Evaluate and compare model performance using MSE, RMSE, and RÂ².
